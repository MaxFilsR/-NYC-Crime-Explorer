# NYC Arrests In 2022: Streamlit Visualization Dashboard

# Dataset
The dataset for this project can be found on [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data) provided by the NYPD Police Department.

This dataset is a list of every arrest in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents an arrest effected in NYC by the NYPD and includes information about the type of crime, the location and time of enforcement. In this project we will only be focussing on the most recent year in the data (2022).

# Objectives

The main objecttive of this project is to develop a streamlit dashboard which users are able to filter the data (187,457 entries) to easily get an understanding of the stake of specifc crimes, borough, age groups, and more in 2022.

To achieve this objective, it was broken down into the following sub-objectives:

1. To perform in-depth exploratory data analysis of the dataset.
2. To determin which forms of data visulization would easily and clearly display the data.
3. To provide a interface that holds the visulizations, easliy filer the data set to answer any of their questions, and provide easy to understadn summeries of the filtered data,.
